# 0x05. Processes and signals
This directory contains scripts on Linux Processes and signals. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Linux PID
* Linux process
* Linux signal
* Process management in Linux

## How to run
All bash scripts contains the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`), the path to bash to execute our scripts. All scripts are marked as executables so they can easily be run as such:
`./file`
