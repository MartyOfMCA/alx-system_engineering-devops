# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
This directory contains scripts on Loops, conditional exectution and parsing in shell. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Portable scripts using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* Variables
* Loops
* Conditional constructs

## How to run
All bash scripts contains the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`), the path to bash to execute our scripts. All scripts are marked as executables so they can easily be run as such:
`./file`
