This directory contains bash scripts on MYSQL database adminitration. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts

## Prerequisites
You need to install in order to test scripts effectively:
* MySQL version 5.7.x [Download](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-mysql-5-7-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can be run using the syntax:

`./bash`
