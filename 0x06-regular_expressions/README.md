# 0x06. Regular expression
This directory contains ruby source files on regular expressions. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Regular expressions

## How to run
All Ruby scripts contains the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env ruby`), the path to runy to execute our scripts. All scripts are marked as executables so they can easily be run as such:
`./file`
